### Hi, I'm Brian.

Biostatistician at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Finishing my PhD in Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill.
                                                                                
My dissertation develops methods for nonstationary spatial extremes: fusing sparse tide gauge observations with hydrodynamic model output to forecast coastal flood risk under climate change. More broadly, I work on extreme value theory, Bayesian spatial modeling, and data fusion for climate and health applications.

**Currently:** forecasting sea-level return levels along the US Atlantic coast, and collaborating on clinical studies across oncology, geriatrics, and surgical outcomes.
