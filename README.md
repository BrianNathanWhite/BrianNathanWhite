### Hi, I'm Brian.

Biostatistician at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Finishing my PhD in Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill.                                                
                                                            
I work on extreme value theory, Bayesian spatial modeling, and climate-health applications.

**Currently:** fusing tide gauge observations with hydrodynamic simulations to forecast coastal flood risk under climate change, modeling opioid misuseprevalence from fragmented surveillance data, and collaborating on clinical studies across oncology, geriatrics, and surgical outcomes.
