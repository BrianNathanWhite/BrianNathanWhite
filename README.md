### Hi, I'm Brian.

Biostatistician at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Finishing my PhD in Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill.

I work on extreme value theory, Bayesian spatial modeling, and applied clinical statistics. My dissertation develops new methods for nonstationary spatial extremes with applications to coastal flood risk under climate change.

**Research areas:** extreme value analysis, spatial statistics, Bayesian hierarchical models, climate risk, clinical biostatistics

**Currently:** writing up dissertation work on sea-level return levels along the US Atlantic coast, collaborating on clinical studies across oncology, geriatrics, and surgical outcomes.
