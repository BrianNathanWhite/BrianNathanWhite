### Hi, I'm Brian.

Biostatistician at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Finishing my PhD in Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill.                                                
                                                            
I work on extreme value theory, Bayesian spatial modeling, and climate-health applications.

**Currently:** fusing tide gauge observations with hydrodynamic simulations to forecast coastal flood risk under climate change, and collaborating on clinical studies across oncology, geriatrics, and surgical outcomes.
